The purpose of this library is to allow developers to create onboard features
in their app and allow users to interact with the developer's app while given a
walk through tutorial.

I would be able to use this on my e-commerce app to show how to get to the
shopping cart. For other apps it could display a step by step tutorial for users
that has never used a smart phone or certain features in an app.
